<h1>Hogwarts Train Scheduler</h1>

If you're heading to Hogwarts, you're not gonna get there with an Uber. You'll need to take the train! Check the latest train schedules right here with "Hogwarts Express: For Wizards on the Go".

The Hogwarts Express app details all of the trains on the daily schedule, coming to and from Hogwarts and King's Cross Station. The special shuttle to Azkaban is also available, in case you have a relative locked up in the joint.

If you work for the train station, you can list new routes in the post section.

As a bonus we even list how long it has been since the last Dementor attack using the moments function.
